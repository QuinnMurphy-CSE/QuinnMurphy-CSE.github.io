        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            As a Freshman Computer Science student at the University of South Carolina, 
            I have learned more about the important role that technology holds in society. 
            My eyes have been widened towards the importance of ethics and sustainability 
            and the technological world. My mission as a computer scientist is to oversee 
            the development of both existing and new technologies that will prove to benefit 
            humanity. I aim to do so using sustainable work practices and focusing on both 
            accessible and ethical solutions to real-world problems. I hope to make the 
            average quality of life of people around the world rise, without putting a 
            substantial strain on the Earth and jobs. I will approach my future career with 
            an open mind, full of innovation, responsibility, and determination. Three 
            characteristics that will prove to strengthen not only my leadership but also 
            my teamwork capabilities while I work towards a positive contribution to the world.
            When looking towards to future, I envision myself overseeing and managing projects 
            that are innovating new technologies and adapting existing technologies for the 
            world to come. Putting technology to use in fields where its potential is not yet 
            being fully utilized and teaching rising computer scientists about the importance 
            of their job.

           </a> 

         <p>High school students struggle to keep track of their assignments and important due
            dates because important class information tends to be scattered across multiple 
            platforms based on what each teacher prefers to use.

            </a>
            <p>I came up with 34 ideas for the assignment tracking solution and organized them 
            into five core themes: Data Integration and Core Technology Components, 
            Student Features and Functionality, UX/UI, Collaboration and Administrator features, 
            and Business and Sustainability

                My sketches demonstrate the introdiction screen, the calendar page, the add resources page, 
                the classes page, the interior of a class in the classes page, and the settings page.
